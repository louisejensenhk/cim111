            <p> Yo, I LOVE Hong Kong, I swear when you come to Hong Kong you would want to live there. The view is amazing. Hong Kong is a city that I miss the most, and that I will always remember. <br> <br>

      The view is amazing at the Peak. One place you need to go to when you are visiting Hong Kong, is The Peak. The Peak also offers a very good hike that you can go on. I like it a lot and it's not that long. Don't worry. <br> <br>

      If you come to Hong Kong and you are looking for a beach to go swimming, you should visit The Repulse Bay Beach. The Repulse Bay Beach is a cool beach. Lot's of people have fun there. You can ask anyone. If you are in Hong Kong when it is Lantern Festival, the Repulse Bay beach is a great place to experience the Chinese lunar moon festival. It's a great place to go with your friends and Family. But it's dark so tell your children not to go swimming or they'll get lost!

      <br> Hope you Enjoy Hong Kong!!!! </p> <br><br>

            <h5>A little about myself <br> Dec 3, 2018</h5> <br>
            <img class="30img" src="images/25.jpg" style="height:600px"> <br><br><br>

            <p><br><br> Hong Kong is a vibrant, exciting city-a stark contrast between Asian and Western cultures, yet both cultures also combine to make the city the dynamic place it is. The city is frequently described as a place where "East meets West", reflecting the local culture's mix of Chinese roots with influences from its time managed by the British. Somehow, Hong Kong manages to balance traditional Chinese practices with a fast paced, modern lifestyle. <br><br>

Hong Kong is ranked as the 3rd most expensive city in Asia after Tokyo and Seoul with the costs of accommodation, food and schooling (if you have children) being the three primary items of expenditure. <br><br>

Accommodation costs are likely to be the largest outgoing; imported foods are also relatively expensive, then there is schooling. Many people prefer to do without a car as the public transport system is so efficient and effective yet, if you do decide to buy a car, the costs of parking alone (both at home and in the office), may be as much as car repayments in some other countries. <br><br>

As one of the world's leading international financial centres, most of the world's largest or most well known (and some not so well known) banks (Citibank, Barclays, Deutsche Bank) have a presence in the city. Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade, and the Hong Kong dollar is in the top 10 of the world's most traded currencies.<br><br>

The per capita income is one of the highest in the world and the public transport travelling rate exceeds 90 percent, the highest in the world. In various other aspects of life in the city, such as its economic freedom, financial and economic competitiveness, quality of life, corruption prevention etc the city state is ranked highly. According to both the UN and WHO estimates, Hong Kong has the longest life expectancy of any country in the world.<br><br>

Some other facts and figures: <br>Hong Kong has an area of some 1,104 km2 (426 sq mi) and this is growing every year due to on-going land reclamation; the official population is just over 7 million and the city is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Hong Kong's population is 95 percent ethnic Chinese and 5 percent from other groups (mainly Filipinos and Indonesians at around 100,000 each group respectively, but also nationalities from many other walks of life such as from the US, UK, Europe and Australia). <br><br>

Actually working in Hong Kong:<br>Most business people speak good English, and government signs are posted in Chinese and English; Cantonese is the spoken dialect of choice, compared with the more widely known Mandarin (Putonghua) used on the Chinese mainland. In fact, some Hong Kong people can't communicate with people from the Mainland owing to the vast differences in dialect and tone between Cantonese and the more formal Mandarin. However, the local populace’s use of Mandarin has been growing rapidly over the last 10 years or so. Chinese concepts like feng shui are taken very seriously and compliance or otherwise with its principles are often believed to make or break a business. Other objects like Ba Gua mirrors are still regularly used to deflect evil spirits and a number of buildings lack a 4th floor as the number when spoken is similar to "die" in Cantonese.<br><br>

Climate:<br>Hong Kong has a subtropical climate and summer is hot and humid with occasional showers and thunderstorms. Typhoons usually originating to the south east frequently threaten the city during the summer months and usually one or two cause precautions to be put in place, with schools, government and other offices closing early; the typhoon warning system is well established though with several tiers to the warnings. Typhoon Warnings are graded on a numeric scale and Rainstorm warnings are graded on a colour scale. When a Typhoon Number 8 signal warning goes out, businesses, public transport and schools close. Schools close when a Red Rainstorm warning is announced and everyone has to stay inside during a Black Rainstorm. Winters are usually mild although the occasional cold front can bring strong, cool winds from the north. Hong Kong averages 1,948 hours of sunshine per year, with the highest and lowest ever recorded temperatures being 36.1 C and 0.0 C, respectively.<br><br>

Healthcare:<br>There are 13 private hospitals such as The Adventist Hospital and more than 50 public hospitals administered by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong in Hong Kong. Amongst the widest range of healthcare services throughout the globe are on offer, and some of the SAR's private hospitals are considered to be among the very best of their type in the world.
After obtaining your ID card, you are eligible for cheap state healthcare but, if you are with a large international or even  a major local company, it is not unreasonable to expect yourself and family to receive dental cover and either BUPA Hong Kong or  BUPA International health cover.If your company insures you with BUPA HK you may have a lower level of cover and may need to pay your medical bills yourself, yet reclaiming up to pre-set limits. <br><br></p>

            <h2> Hong Kong's Hotspots </h2> <br><br>
            <h5> Beautiful unknown tourist areas & nature spots in Hong Kong, Dec 3, 2018</h5> <br><br>
            <img class="images" src="images/31.jpg" style="height:460px"> <br><br><br>
            <p> To many it may come as a surprise, but in Hong Kong you'll find numerous secluded beaches, stunning areas of natural beauty and jungle pools awaiting your discovery. <br><br>

<h3>1. Tai Long Wan beach: </h3><br> With its pristine white sand and crystal clear water, Tai Long Wan feels like a slice of rural Thailand has been dropped on to one of the worlds most densely populated urban hubs body-surf in the clean, rolling waves, and you'll question whether frenetic Central is even in the same time zone. Like many astonishingly beautiful places, Tai Long Wan isn’t easy to get to. Helicopters and private boats from Central are on offer, but for mere mortals, the MTR train to Sai Kung, followed by the 94 bus and an hour long hike are the best option hopefully adding to the Robinson Crusoe effect of it all. Make a day trip of it, and eat in one of the small noodle bars in the jungle behind the beach.<br><br>

<h3>2. South Bay beach: </h3><br> Unlike most major city beaches, South Bay doesn't come with a stack of skyscrapers or a waterfront of heaving bars. Instead, there is one rickety cafe selling coconut water and sandwiches, fringed by thick, seemingly impenetrable jungle reaching all the way up to the Peak. Now, this "deserted island" aesthetic is an illusion, as South Bay beach is actually in the heart of Hong Kong - a mere stroll from teeming Repulse Bay and a 20 minute drive from Central. But inaccessible by public transport (take a taxi from the nearest bus stop) and bordered by national parkland, it is the ideal way to close the door on city life for an hour; crack open a coconut and relax.<br><br>

<h3>3. Tai Tam Mound Waterfall: </h3> <br> Hong Kong is a city that pulsates with energy - sometimes the only way to step back and recharge is by finding a slice of solitude to escape to. And Tai Tam’s thick jungle and rocky hikes provide the perfect opportunity for a little contemplation. Follow the trail to the Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir where, hidden amid dense vegetation above the lake, is a small, sign less path leading to the delightful Tai Tam Mound Waterfall. Impossible to find if you don’t know it's there, savvy hikers often bask in the pleasure of having this clean stream and tranquil pool entirely to themselves.<br><br>

Aside from Nature there is also cool tourist areas to go visit!! <br><br>

<h3>4. Victoria Peak: </h3><br> Lush lookout point with telescopes. Mountain on Hong Kong island (elevation 1,181 feet) known for its skyline & waterfront views. Victoria Peak is a hill on the western half of Hong Kong Island. It is also known as Mount Austin, and locally as The Peak. With an elevation of 552 m, it is the highest hill on Hong Kong island, ranked 31 in terms of elevation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.<br><br>

<h3>5. Wanchai Wet Market:</h3><br> It is located at 264 Queen's Road East, at Wan Chai Road crossing, opposite Stone Nullah Lane in Wan Chai, Hong Kong Island... The Wan Chai Market was initially a wet place where merchants would sell their belongings. It was also used as a garage for Bullock Carts, which means 'Wet Garage'. Highly recommend going if looking for a culture shock. <br><br>

<h3>6. Ladies Market Mongkok: </h3><br> With over 100 stalls of bargain clothing, accessories and souvenirs, the Ladies' Market on Tung Choi Street provides a one-kilometre stretch on which to practise your haggling skills. It gets its name from the huge amount of clothing and accessories on sale for women of all ages; however, with watches, cosmetics, bags, home furnishings, CDs and trinkets also up for grabs, you don’t need to be just in the market for a pair of nylon stockings to find something within its crowded aisles. <br><br>

<h3>7. Times Square, Causeway Bay: </h3><br> People come from far and wide to shop in Causeway Bay, and they'll rarely leave without stepping foot inside its grand prize - Times Square. Sitting on top of a MTR Causeway Bay Station exit, the district's largest shopping mall has 230 stores spanning mid-price to luxury fashion and accessories, electronics and toys, two department stores, a supermarket and over 20 restaurants dishing out top-grade Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Western fare. <br><br>

<h3>8. Tian Tan Buddha:</h3> <br> Landmark hilltop statue of Buddha. 260 steps lead up to this immense Buddha made of bronze, with carved bell, museum and relics inside. The Big Buddha, is a large bronze statue of Buddha Shakyamuni, completed in 1993, and located at Ngong Ping, Lantau Island, in Hong Kong. The statue is sited near Po Lin Monastery and symbolises the harmonious relationship between man and nature, people and faith. <br><br>
