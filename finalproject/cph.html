              <h5>This is where I come from, Dec 3, 2018</h5> <br>
              <p> Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, sits on the coastal islands of Zealand and Amager. It's linked to Malmo in southern Sweden by the Oresund Bridge. Indre By, the city's historic center, contains Frederiksstaden, an 18th-century rococo district, home to the royal family's Amalienborg Palace. Nearby is Christiansborg Palace and the Renaissance-era Rosenborg Castle, surrounded by gardens and home to the crown jewels.<br><br>

            <img class="images" src="images/105.jpg" style="height:550px"> <br> <br>
            <p> <h1>Tisvilde, Denmark</h1> <br><br> Tisvilde is a small town with a population of 1,537 located on the north coast of the island Zealand in Denmark 60 km in Gribskov Municipality, northeast of Hillerod. Tisvildeleje is the coastal part of Tisvilde. "Leje" roughly translates as 'plain' and used to be a fishermans village. Broad beaches, a holy spring, and rock music in the open air. Tisvilde on the Danish Riviera has something for everyone and plenty of everything: warm hospitality, beautiful scenery, great art and culture, and wonderful food. In short - everything on the wishlist for a good holiday. <br><br>

As you stroll along the narrow main street past the thatched fishermen's cottages, you arrive literally at the water's edge. Here it becomes clear why Tisvildeleje is one of the most popular resorts on the Danish Riviera. Way back in the middle ages pilgrims travelled here to drink from the holy Saint Helene Spring (Sankt Helene Kilde) which provided water for King Christian IV. Later, famous artists and writers such as Asger Jorn and Johannes V. Jensen sought contemplation here. <br><br>

Today it is especially the creative Copenhageners that enjoy Tisvildeleje's sanctuary from everyday life. Here you can kick-back, relax, and enjoy the carefree atmosphere.</p> <br><br>
